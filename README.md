# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Coded by Eric Brown

1. Index.html
  This is the main home page for the assignment. Here you can see all of the links to get to different pages that hold different requirements for the Project.

2. List.html
  Contains an example of an ordered and unordered list.

3. Image.html
  Contains and example of an Image. This image scales with the window size.

4. Table.html
  Contains a example table.

5. Bootstrap.html
  Contains an alert, loading bar, and 3 row elements. Theses dynamically scale with the page size.

Other notes:
  - If the page becomes less than 600px in width, it turns red and lowers the font size
  - If the page exceeds 1500px in width, it turns green and enlarges the font size
  - I included my scss file so you can see the examples of variables, nesting, and inheritance. They come as $font-stack/$primary-color, #image nesting, and #table inheritance.
